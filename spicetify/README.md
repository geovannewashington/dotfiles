Using Spicetify is definitely not entirely safe. It’s popular among “ricers” because it allows injecting CSS and JavaScript into the Spotify Electron client, making it a client-side modification. If you install an ad blocker (like I do), Spicetify can access analytics about ad impressions on free accounts and might flag your usage.

That said, I don’t mind and use it myself. I recommend not using your package manager to install it, follow the official documentation instead: [Spicetify Getting Started
](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started).
