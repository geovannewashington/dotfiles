`$HOME/core/bin` is where my personal utility Bash scripts live 🛠️.

Here you’ll find a variety of tools, including backup scripts, screenshot scripts, and more. Since this directory is included in my PATH (see `zsh/env/path.sh`), some scripts are not suffixed with `.sh`, allowing me to use them as if they were system-installed binaries ⚡.
