I'm not a Neovim specialist, and while typing speed is a factor, it’s not the main reason I use it. Neovim is my editor of choice because, in my setup, a terminal-based editor makes the most sense and integrates seamlessly with other CLI tools. In fact, it’s the only text editor installed on my computer.

It can open my root directory in milliseconds. Beyond typing speed, navigating and exploring a codebase with Neovim and its major plugins, such as Telescope, is extremely efficient. Once you get used to it, there’s no going back.
